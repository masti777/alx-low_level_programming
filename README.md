Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX software engineering. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

    0x00. C - Hello, World
    0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
    0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
